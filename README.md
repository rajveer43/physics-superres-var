# Physics super-resolution with VAR-style next-scale prediction

ML4Sci / CMS / E2E project: map coarse calorimeter data back to high resolution
with a Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) transformer. The result is judged by physics
observables and by downstream taggers, not by SSIM/PSNR.

| Dataset | Content | HR grid | LR levels (sum-pooled) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qg` | CMS quark/gluon jet images, channels tracks / ECAL / HCAL | 3 x 125 x 125 (padded to 128) | `pool2x2` (64²), `pool4x4` (32²), `pool8x8` (16²) |
| `calo` | CaloChallenge 2022 Dataset 2, e⁻ showers 1 GeV–1 TeV | 45 layers x 16 angle x 9 radius (padded to 48 layers) | `pool1x2x1`, `pool1x4x3`, `pool3x8x3` |

Level names give the pooling factor per axis. `pool3x8x3` merges 3 layers x 8 angular x 3 radial cells into one.

**Why only up to the native resolution:** there is no ground truth above
125 x 125 (qg) or 45 x 16 x 9 (calo). Output beyond those grids could not be
checked against anything, so the SR target is always the native HR grid, which
means 2x, 4x and 8x upscaling for jets.

## Method

1. **Energy-preserving down-sampling.** Each LR cell is the *sum* of the HR cells
   it covers, which is what a detector with larger cells would record. Total
   energy is exactly conserved.
2. **Multi-scale residual VQ-VAE** (VAR paper, Algorithms 1 and 2). It works on
   `log1p(E / s_c)` images and encodes each HR image into K token maps
   (qg: 1² … 32², one token per 4×4 pixels; calo: 1x1x1 … 12x4x9). The codebook
   is shared across scales. LPIPS and GAN losses are replaced by physics terms:
   - the decoder has two heads per channel: **hit or not** (cross-entropy against
     E > readout threshold) and **log-energy if hit** (MSE on hit cells only).
     Cells without a predicted hit are exactly zero, as after detector zero
     suppression, so the output has no diffuse background;
   - a **per-channel energy loss**, so energy cannot move from one sub-detector
     to another (e.g. tracks into ECAL);
   - the decoder also sees the **LR image** (trained with every LR level in
     turn), so layout that the measurement already fixes does not have to pass
     through the tokens.
3. **Conditional VAR transformer.** Next-scale prediction with a block-causal
   mask, AdaLN and L2-normalised q/k, as in the paper. The class-label start
   token is replaced by the LR measurement. An LR encoder provides the start
   token and the AdaLN condition, and adds a spatial feature map to every
   scale's tokens. One model is trained per LR level.
4. **What is compared.** The result is the model output exactly as generated
   (`sr`), set against the HR truth and the LR input. The training target is
   always the HR truth: the tokenizer learns to rebuild HR images, and the
   transformer learns to predict the tokens of the HR image from the LR image.
5. **Downstream taggers.** One CNN architecture is tuned once on HR, then
   trained separately on HR, each LR grid and each SR output.
   - qg: quark vs gluon classification
   - calo: incident-energy regression
6. **Diagnostics**, kept out of the main figures and tables:
   - `vqrec`: HR → tokens → HR by the tokenizer alone (decoded with the same
     LR image). This is the best any token-predicting model could do with this
     tokenizer.
   - `sr-sample`: tokens drawn from the predicted distribution (temperature
     0.8, top-k 50). The main result `sr` uses the most likely token (greedy).
   - `uniform`: each coarse cell's energy spread evenly over its fine cells, a
     no-learning reference.
   - `srproj`: SR rescaled so every coarse cell matches its measured energy.
     It is post-processing and never part of training.

The 2-D (jets) and 3-D (showers) models share code. The calorimeter angular axis
uses periodic padding.

## Metrics (chosen to be read directly by physicists)

| Question | Metric |
|---|---|
| Does SR recover the right physics distributions? | W1 distance / σ_HR, KS statistic, mean shift, for each observable |
| Is each event reconstructed correctly? | Per-event bias (median) and resolution (IQR/1.349) of SR vs true observable |
| Is SR consistent with what was measured? | LR closure: Σ\|pool(SR) − LR\| / Σ LR |
| Can a network tell SR from truth? | Classifier two-sample test AUC (0.5 = indistinguishable) |
| Does SR help an analysis? (qg) | Tagger ROC AUC and background rejection 1/ε_B at ε_S = 30/50/70%, bootstrap errors |
| Does SR help an analysis? (calo) | Energy response bias and resolution σ_eff/E, overall and per energy bin |

Observables used:
- Jets: per-channel and total energy, jet pT, jet mass, girth, p_TD, τ₂₁ (N-subjettiness), hit multiplicity, radial pT profile.
- Showers: E_dep/E_inc, shower depth centroid and width, radial centroid and width, lateral x/y centroid, energy fractions in early/mid/late layers, hit count, longitudinal and radial profiles, cell-energy spectrum.

## Running on Colab

### Get the code into Colab

Open the notebook straight from GitHub:
[colab.research.google.com/github/rajveer43/physics-superres-var/blob/main/notebooks/superres_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rajveer43/physics-superres-var/blob/main/notebooks/superres_colab.ipynb)

Its first code cell clones this repository into `/content/superres_code`. Each
later run of that cell pulls the latest commit, so to change code you push to
GitHub and re-run the cell. The runtime doesn't need restarting.

### Run it

1. Set the runtime to GPU.
2. Keep `SMOKE = True` and run all cells. This is a quick pass on a tiny subset
   with 1–2 epochs, and it writes to `MyDrive/GSoC_SuperRes/smoke_tests/`.
   `FAKE_DATA = True` does the same on synthetic data, with no download.
3. Set `SMOKE = False` and run all cells again for the real results.
4. Change `DATASET` to `'calo'` or `'qg'` and repeat. Run one dataset per
   runtime, and delete the other dataset's cache first if disk is short.

Command-line alternative (for example on a cluster):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m superres.pipeline --dataset calo --stages all --set paths.drive_root=/path/experiments run_date=2026-10-06 run_tag=multiseed
python -m superres.pipeline --dataset qg --stages train_var,generate --levels pool8x8 --set var.epochs=20
python tests/smoke_test.py --root /tmp/superres_smoke      # synthetic end-to-end check
```

### Stages

| Stage | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `download` | Zenodo (calo, md5-checked) or CERNBox share over WebDAV (qg); resumable `wget -c` | `/content/data/raw/<ds>/` |
| `prepare` | Pad, clip negatives, sum-pool to every LR level, split into train/val/test, per-channel energy scale | `/content/data/cache/<ds>/*.npy`, `data_meta.json` on Drive |
| `tune_vqvae` | Optuna: lr, codebook size, latent channels, β, energy weight, width | `tuning/<name>_vqvae_tokenizer*` |
| `train_vqvae` | Full VQ-VAE training with the tuned parameters; logs hit precision / recall / count ratio | `models/vqvae_tokenizer/` |
| `tune_var` | Optuna on the hardest level: depth (width = 64·depth), lr, dropout, weight decay, label smoothing | `tuning/<name>_var_transformer_all*` |
| `train_var` | One conditional VAR per LR level | `models/var_transformer_<level>/` |
| `generate` | VAR output as generated: `var.decode` (greedy) for the splits in `var.gen_splits`, other decodings in `var.decodes` for test only | `<cache>/<ds>/<split>_<name>_sr-<decode>_<level>.npy` |
| `eval_sr` | HR vs LR vs SR: observables, W1/KS, per-event bias and resolution, LR closure, C2ST, plots incl. per-channel events; diagnostics in `figures/diagnostics/` | `evaluation/sr_<level>/` |
| `tune_tagger` | Optuna on HR: lr, dropout, weight decay, width | `tuning/<name>_cnn_tagger_hr*` |
| `train_taggers` | Tagger/regressor for `hr`, then `lr` and `sr` at every level, for each seed | `models/cnn_tagger_<input>_seed<seed>/` (calo: `cnn_regressor_…`) |
| `summarize` | Tables, plots and a markdown report across all runs | `summary/` |

Every training stage resumes from `last.pt` on Drive. Optuna studies resume from
their database copy on Drive. After a disconnect, re-run the notebook from the top.

```

- `<name>` = `<dataset>_<version>_<date>_<tag>`, e.g. `qg_v2_2026-10-06_multiseed`, starts every
  file name, so a figure copied elsewhere still says which experiment it is from. `_` separates
  fields and `-` joins words inside a field.
- `version` comes from `config.py` (`"version": "v2"`): change it for a new model design.
- `run_date` (start date) and `run_tag` (what the experiment tests, e.g. `multiseed`) name the
  experiment. Reuse both to resume or re-evaluate; a new date or tag starts from scratch and has its
  own Optuna studies. SR outputs in the shared local cache carry `<name>` too.
- `<input>` is `hr`, `lr-<level>`, `sr-<level>`, `uniform-<level>` or `srproj-<level>`.
- The Colab notebook pulls branch `v2-eval-tagger-checks`, which still uses the previous naming
  (`<dataset>/<version>/<date>-<tag>/runs/...`).
- Names contain no timestamps, so later stages can find earlier outputs. The
  creation time is stored in `config.json` instead.

### Disk budget (local Colab disk; the free tier has about 100 GB)

Worked out from array sizes with the default settings:

| | qg (40k jets) | calo (100k + 100k showers) |
|---|---|---|
| raw download | size of the CERNBox share (not checked) | 2.8 GB |
| HR cache (float32) | 7.9 GB | 5.5 GB |
| LR caches | 2.6 GB | 3.3 GB |
| SR caches, 3 levels | 11.8 GB (float16) | 16.6 GB (float32) |
| **total** | **about 22 GB + raw** | **about 28 GB** |

Lower `data.max_samples` (qg) or `data.max_samples` / `data.test_max` (calo) if
disk or RAM is tight. Drive only receives checkpoints, metrics and figures, a
few hundred MB per dataset.

### Time budget

Not measured yet. Run the smoke pass first; the epoch times it prints in
`history.csv` let you scale the full settings. As a rough guide on a T4:

- VAR training is the dominant cost: one model per level, about 650–700 tokens
  per image.
- For a first full pass, `var.epochs` of 15–20 and `optuna.var_trials` of about
  5 should fit in a Colab session.
- Stages are independent, so they can run across several sessions.
- On an A100 or L4 the code uses bf16 automatically.

## Running on Perlmutter (NERSC)

`slurm/` runs the same stages as a chain of single-GPU Slurm jobs (levels, tagger inputs and seeds in
parallel), configured by one file, `slurm/settings.sh`. Step-by-step instructions: [README_PERLMUTTER.md](README_PERLMUTTER.md).

## Assumptions to check on the first real run

- **CERNBox access.** The public-share WebDAV endpoint was not tested (no network
  access while writing this). If `download` fails, put direct links in
  `data.extra_urls` or copy the files into `/content/data/raw/qg/`.
- **Jet file format.** The loader auto-detects `.pt` contents (a dict, tuple or
  TensorDataset; channels first or last), as well as parquet, h5 and npz. Check
  the label counts printed by `prepare`. Class `data.signal_label` (default 1)
  is the signal for 1/ε_B.
- **Jet geometry.** `data.pixel_size = 0.0174` (the ECAL crystal size in η–φ)
  sets the coordinates for jet mass, pT and τ₂₁. Comparisons between HR and SR
  do not depend on it.
- **Calo geometry.** The radial bin edges in `config.CALO_R_EDGES` are the
  Dataset 2 values from `binning_dataset_2.xml`. Voxels are ordered
  (layer, angle, radius), as in the CaloChallenge code.
- **Testing so far.** The pipeline has not been run end to end yet. Run
  `tests/smoke_test.py` or the notebook with `FAKE_DATA = True` before the long runs.
